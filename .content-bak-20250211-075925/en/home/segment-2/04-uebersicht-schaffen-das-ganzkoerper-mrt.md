A full-body MRI is the best-invested hour for your health â€“ ideally combined with a comprehensive blood test. There are other examinations that might be more suitable in your case, possibly more beneficial than an MRI: This could be the analysis of important genetic markers or an examination that is even more relevant to your personal health interests, such as a colonoscopy.

If you want to know more, take the self-test. You will receive a recommendation on which preventive measures are suitable for you. We base our recommendations on the guidelines of medical societies and on a simple principle: **We only recommend what we would also suggest to a good friend.**
