We donâ€™t just run a standard program. Depending on its configuration, an MRI scan can focus on different aspects of imaging. This means: Depending on the question at hand, an adapted protocol provides the most insightful images. Therefore, before the scan, there is always an anamnesis and determination of examination priorities.

Then follows the actual examination in the open scanner, which takes about 60 minutes. During this time, up to 4,000 images are taken, from which we calculate a 3D model of your entire body.
