title: "Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRI)"
---

The Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT), also known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or MRI, is an imaging procedure that functions without the use of X-rays and relies on a strong magnetic field and radio waves. This technology enables the creation of detailed cross-sectional images of organs and tissues in the body, thereby making precise diagnoses possible for many diseases.

The procedure is particularly gentle since it does not use ionizing radiation. Instead, the magnetic field generates images that are processed by a computer and analyzed by radiologists. Magnetic Resonance Tomography is suitable for examining the entire body, including muscle, skeleton, brain, organs, and blood vessels.

Common MRI examinations include:

- **Musculoskeletal examinations:** MRTs of the spine, joints (such as hips, knees, shoulders, and wrist), soft tissues, and tendons.
- **Neuroradiological examinations:** MRI of the brain, spinal cord, nerve strands, and specialized procedures like MR angiography and myelography.
- **Thorax, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** Examination of the lung, liver, pancreas, prostate, and other organs. MR angiograms are also possible.
- **Cardiac examinations:** MRT of the heart, including perfusion and functional analyses.
- **Special procedures:** MR arthrograms, MRCP for gallbladder imaging, MR spectroscopy for tissue characterization.

During the examination, you will lie on a table that is inserted into the MRT tube. The diameter is usually 60 to 70 cm, and the length is 150 to 200 cm. For patients with claustrophobia, open devices are often available. You can communicate with staff at any time using a call button.

The MRI is a non-invasive, radiation-free method for making precise diagnoses.
