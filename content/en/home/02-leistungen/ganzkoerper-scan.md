A whole-body MRI scan generates high-resolution sectional images of the entire body using magnetic fields and radio waves.

The full-body scan, particularly when combined with other diagnostic procedures, enables a comprehensive assessment of your health status and can detect noticeable changes at an early stage. This allows for preventive treatment before symptoms appear.

The scan is particularly recommended for individuals over 40 years old, those with a family history or those experiencing persistent complaints without known causes. Our prevention doctors analyze all findings and explain the results in a personal consultation.
