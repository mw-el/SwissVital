Our comprehensive laboratory analysis provides a detailed insight into your metabolic processes and internal bodily functions. Through blood testing, we can determine important health parameters and recognize risks early on, long before clinical symptoms appear.

The standard analysis includes over 40 different parameters, including blood count, liver and kidney values, electrolytes, blood sugar, cholesterol, and other fatty acid values, inflammation markers, thyroid hormone levels, as well as vitamins and minerals. Depending on your individual situation, additional specific tests can be performed, such as hormone status, allergy testing, genetic analysis, or special tumor markers.

The laboratory analysis can be ideally combined with an MRI scan to obtain a comprehensive picture of your health. This holistic screening enables precise health prevention at the highest level. The blood draw takes place in our center, usually on the day when the MRI is also performed. Depending on the scope of the analyses, the results are available within 1-3 working days.

Our preventive physicians analyze all test results and explain the outcome to you in a personal consultation.
