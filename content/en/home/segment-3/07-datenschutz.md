When it comes to health data, privacy is crucial.

We treat your data confidentially. We do not profit from therapies and always give advice that we would also give to a good friend. Moreover, we go a step further by storing your data in one of the world's most secure server locations, where only you and your treating physician at SwissVital have access. You alone decide who can view your data and to what extent. If desired, you can revoke our access with the push of a button – in that case, we will only be able to see your data again once you grant us permission.
