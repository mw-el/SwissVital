We complement imaging diagnostics with analytical procedures to provide you with the best possible preventive care and diagnostics.

#### Imaging procedures

* **Ultrasound** offers a quick and effective way to assess soft tissue injuries like tendinitis or bursitis.
* **MRI** is particularly suitable for detecting deeper injuries to muscles, tendons and joints.
* **X-ray** is used to evaluate fractures, joint wear and structural changes.

#### Blood analysis

Inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR can indicate inflammation in the body and help differentiate between acute and chronic problems. For suspected infections or autoimmune diseases that may aggravate sports-related complaints, specific auto-antibodies can be tested in the blood.
