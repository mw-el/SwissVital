Common sports injuries and degenerative conditions of the hip joint and pelvic girdle arise from over‑ or mis‑loading as well as natural age‑related wear. 

**Trochanteric bursitis** often develops through repetitive loading during activities such as running, cycling or prolonged sitting, where the outside of the hip is repeatedly stressed. 

**Hip impingement (FAI)** frequently results from malalignment of the hip joint or excessive sporting load and causes friction between the femoral head and the acetabulum. 

**Osteoarthritis** of the hip joint (coxarthrosis) is usually the result of repeated over‑load or natural ageing processes, leading to progressive cartilage wear. 

An **adductor or groin strain** often occurs after sudden movements such as quick changes of direction or rapid acceleration and causes pain in the thigh and groin. 

These conditions can arise from insufficient recovery, poor technique or overexertion and should be treated early to avoid long‑lasting damage.
