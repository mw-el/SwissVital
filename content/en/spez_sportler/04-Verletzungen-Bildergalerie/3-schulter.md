Common **sports injuries of the shoulder joint** and the rotator cuff arise from over‑ or mis‑loading, as in throwing or swimming. 

These include **rotator‑cuff injuries**, which cause shoulder pain, especially during overhead movements, sometimes accompanied by weakness or muscle wasting. 

Another example is **shoulder impingement syndrome**, in which repeated loads pinch tendons under the acromion, leading to pain on movements above shoulder height and limited shoulder mobility. 

Degenerative changes such as **osteoarthritis** of the shoulder joint can also arise from repeated over‑load and lead to shoulder pain and increasing restriction of movement. 

In a **shoulder dislocation**, often after a fall, severe pain, visible misalignment and restricted joint movement occur. 

A **bursitis** (inflammation of the bursa), which can be caused by improper movements, can likewise lead to swelling and painful limitation of motion. 

It is important to treat these injuries and degenerative changes early to prevent permanent damage.
