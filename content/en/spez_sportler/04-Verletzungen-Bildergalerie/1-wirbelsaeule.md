Common spinal conditions caused by sport, over‑ or mis‑loading include disc problems such as a **herniated disc**, where the nucleus pulposus presses on nerves, leading to back pain and numbness. 

Spondylosis **(spinal osteoarthritis)** is degeneration of the discs and facet joints, often triggered by repeated loading or poor posture, and causes a stiff back, pain and limited mobility. 

**Spondylolisthesis** occurs when a vertebra slips forward or backward because of wear or injury, causing pain and movement problems. 

**Sciatica**, irritation of the sciatic nerve, is caused by over‑load or poor posture of the spine and leads to pain radiating down the leg. 

**Degenerative spinal disorders**, such as spinal canal stenosis where the space around the spinal cord narrows, can lead to nerve pain and restricted movement. 

Another common condition is **cervical spondylosis**, which is caused by wear of the cervical spine and results in neck stiffness and headaches. 

These disorders often arise from incorrect movements, lack of stability or repeated loads. Early treatment helps prevent long‑term damage.
