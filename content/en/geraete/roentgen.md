title: "Classic X-ray"
---

The classic X-ray is one of the oldest imaging procedures and is primarily used for rapid diagnosis of bone fractures and lung diseases. During the examination, X-rays are guided through the body, which are absorbed differently depending on the tissue. This results in contrast-rich images, showing bones, organs, and tissue.

Typical applications:

- **Bones:** Detection of fractures and misalignments.
- **Chest:** Examination of the lungs and heart.
- **Joints:** Determination of arthritis or inflammation.
- **Teeth:** Control of tooth and jaw structures.

The examination only takes a few minutes and is pain-free. Modern equipment minimizes radiation exposure as much as possible.
