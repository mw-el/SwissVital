title: "Computed Tomography (CT)"
---

The computed tomography (CT) is an imaging procedure that creates detailed cross-sectional images of your body using X-ray radiation. Unlike traditional X-ray, CT uses many individual images taken from different angles, which a computer combines into a single image.

Applications:

- **Chest:** Detection of lung diseases, tumors, and embolisms.
- **Abdomen/Pelvis:** Diagnosis of liver, kidney, and bowel diseases.
- **Head:** Determination of strokes, bleeding, and skull injuries.
- **Vessels:** CT angiography for vessel display.
- **Bones:** Detailed analysis of fractures.

The examination is quick, efficient, and especially crucial in emergency situations. Modern devices minimize radiation exposure to a minimum.
