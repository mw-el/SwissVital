The Ultrasound, also known as Sonography, is an imaging procedure that serves to diagnose numerous diseases. Unlike MRI or CT scans, Ultrasound does not use X-rays but rather high-frequency sound waves. This method is pain-free, safe, and primarily used for examining soft tissues.

During the examination, a gel is applied to the skin to improve ultrasound transmission. The transducer sends out waves that are reflected by bodily tissue. A computer converts these signals into images that can be viewed in real-time.

Common applications include:

- **Abdomen:** Examination of liver, kidneys, gallbladder, pancreas.
- **Pelvis:** Evaluation of bladder, uterus, ovaries, prostate.
- **Vessels:** Doppler Ultrasound for analyzing blood flow and vessel narrowing.
- **Musculoskeletal System:** Diagnostic evaluation at joints, tendons, muscles.

Ultrasound is flexible, quickly deployable, and carries no radiation risks â€“ ideal for pregnant women and children as well.
